# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# m = Merchant.create([ { name: 'Kick cafe' }, { body: 'Serving Mediterranean tapas and playing fusball' }, { avgprice: 5 }, { image_name: 'https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/9b/71/15/9b7115693447433aee80d7a033dc3b09.jpg' }])
